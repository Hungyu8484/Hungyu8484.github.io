\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 For a long time, I was convinced that emotion and logic lived in separate universes. I believed I had to pick a side, constantly feeling like I was being pulled in two different directions. But something happened that completely reshaped my understanding of both. Instead of clashing, they began to make sense together in a way I never imagined. In today\'92s talk, I\'92ll share how that moment helped me reconnect with both sides of myself and unexpectedly opened up an entirely new path. If you\'92ve ever felt caught between worlds, my story just might resonate with you.}
